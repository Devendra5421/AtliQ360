AtliQ Hardware, a rapidly growing company, has decided to use PowerBi for data analytics to gain a competitive edge and make informed decisions. This project aims to provide insights into various aspects such as finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain.

My name is Devendra and I worked on a project recently. I followed the Codebasics PowerBi Course and used a variety of tools and techniques to complete the project. Some of the tools and techniques that I used include data visualization, data modeling, DAX formulas, Power Query, and Power BI Desktop. It was a great learning experience and I'm excited to apply these skills to future projects as well


## Tech Stack:

## Company Background:
 AtliQ Hardware sells computers and accessories through retailers and direct distributors worldwide. They recently faced unexpected losses in their American store due to decisions based on surveys, intuition, and limited Excel analysis. To compete better, the company needs to build an analytics team for data-driven insights and decisions.

## Project Outcome: 
This project aims to clarify the purpose and goals of the data analytics initiative. The report generated will enable data-driven decision-making and answer numerous questions about the company's performance. It's a step towards surviving and thriving in the industry.
